Many cookies contain a\n        so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie.\n        It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and\n        servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the\n        cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to\n        differentiate the individual browser of the dats subject from other\n        Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet\n        browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Through the use of cookies, the heinrichneedshousing.com can provide the\n        users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be\n        possible without the cookie setting.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be\n        optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as previously\n        mentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose of this\n        recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website. The\n        website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access data\n        each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the\n        website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user's computer system.\n        Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop. The\n        online store remembers the articles that a customer has placed in the\n        virtual shopping cart via a cookie.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies\n        through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet\n        browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.\n        Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an\n        Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all\n        popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting\n        of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our\n        website may be entirely usable.\n      </p>\n\n      <h4>4.

This general data and information are stored in the server\n        log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2)\n        the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from\n        which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4)\n        the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site,\n        (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service\n        provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and\n        information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information\n        technology systems.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        When using these general data and information, the\n        heinrichneedshousing.com does not draw any conclusions about the data\n        subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content\n        of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as\n        well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our\n        information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide\n        law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal\n        prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the\n        heinrichneedshousing.com analyzes anonymously collected data and\n        information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data\n        protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal\n        level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data\n        of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data\n        provided by a data subject.\n      </p>\n\n      <h4>5. Contact possibility via the website </h4>\n      <p>\n        The website of the heinrichneedshousing.com contains information that\n        enables a quick electronic contact to our enterprise, as well as direct\n        communication with us, which also includes a general address of the\n        so-called electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject contacts\n        the controller by e-mail or via a contact form, the personal data\n        transmitted by the data subject are automatically stored. Such personal\n        data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the data\n        controller are stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the\n        data subject. There is no transfer of this personal data to third\n        parties.\n      </p>\n\n      <h4>6.

During the course of this technical procedure, Instagram\n        becomes aware of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by\n        the data subject.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Instagram,\n        Instagram detects with every call-up to our website by the data\n        subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet\n        site—which specific sub-page of our Internet page was visited by the\n        data subject. This information is collected through the Instagram\n        component and is associated with the respective Instagram account of the\n        data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the Instagram buttons\n        integrated on our website, then Instagram matches this information with\n        the personal Instagram user account of the data subject and stores the\n        personal data.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Instagram receives information via the Instagram component that the data\n        subject has visited our website provided that the data subject is logged\n        in at Instagram at the time of the call to our website.

Legal basis for the processing </h4>\n      <p>\n        Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing\n        operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing\n        purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the\n        performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the\n        case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the\n        supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based\n        on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing\n        operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual\n        measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products\n        or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which\n        processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of\n        tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In\n        rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect\n        the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.\n        This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our\n        company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital\n        information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other\n        third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d\n        GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit.\n        f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not\n        covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is\n        necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our\n        company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden\n        by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject\n        which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations\n        are particularly permissible because they have been specifically\n        mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate\n        interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the\n        controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).\n      </p>\n\n      <h4>\n        11. The legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third\n        party\n      </h4>\n      <p>\n        Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f\n        GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of\n        the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.\n      </p>\n\n      <h4>12. Period for which the personal data will be stored</h4>\n      <p>\n        The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is\n        the respective statutory retention period. After expiration of that\n        period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no\n        longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation\n        of a contract.\n      </p>\n\n      <h4>\n        13. Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement;\n        Requirement necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data\n        subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of failure\n        to provide such data{\" \"}\n      </h4>\n      <p>\n        We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law\n        (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions\n        (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be\n        necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with\n        personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us. The data\n        subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when\n        our company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the\n        personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data\n        subject could not be concluded. Before personal data is provided by the\n        data subject, the data subject must contact any employee. The employee\n        clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data\n        is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the\n        contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data\n        and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.\n      </p>\n\n      <h4>14. Existence of automated decision-making</h4>\n      <p>\n        As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or\n        profiling.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Developed by the specialists for{\" \"}\n        <a href=\"https://willing-able.com/\">LegalTech</a> at Willing & Able that\n        also developed the system for{\" \"}\n        <a href=\"https://abletorecords.com/\">dpia risk assessment</a>.
